## First-Time Installation

There are several ways to install <span class="keyword">Aquarium</span>.

## RubyGems

This is the preferred approach. Non-windows users may have to use <code>sudo</code> for each command. Install or update to the latest with:
<pre>
gem install aquarium
gem update aquarium

</pre>

or if you want an older version:
<pre>
gem install aquarium -v 0.6.0
gem update aquarium -v 0.6.0

</pre>

## Notes on Updating

### Updating to Aquarium-0.7.X

Version 0.7.X supports only Ruby 2.6 or newer. It was tested with 2.7.0p83 (2020-03-31 revision a0c7c23c9c), 2.6.3p62 (2019-04-16 revision 67580). Basic JRuby 9.2.7.0 (2.5.3) 2019-04-09 8a269e3 support is provided, but using JRuby currently does *not* pass all the custom Java specs in the `jruby/spec` directory, which specifically test working with Java classes. However, JRuby does pass all the Ruby specs in the `spec` directory. This is a long-standing issue with JRuby support in Aquarium. Patches are welcome!

**TODO:** There are currently a _lot_ of deprecation warnings.

### Updating to Aquarium-0.6.X

Version 0.6.0 supports only Ruby 2.0.0p247. Basic JRuby 1.7.4 (1.9.3p392) support is provided, but using JRuby currently does *not* pass all the custom Java specs in the `jruby/spec` directory, which specifically test working with Java classes. However, JRuby does pass all the Ruby specs in the `spec` directory. I didn't want to release v0.6.0 with the Java-specific specs not working, but I didn't have time to resolve the issues. Patches are welcome.

See [UPGRADE] for details for older releases.
