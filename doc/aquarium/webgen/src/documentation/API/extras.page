## Extras

See also the <a href="../../rdoc/index.html" target="rdoc">Aquarium Rdocs</a>.

Extras are tools that use <span class="keyword">Aquarium</span>, but are not imported automatically when requiring [aquarium.rb]. Instead, you have to require [aquarium/extras.rb] explicitly.

[aquarium.rb]:https://github.com/deanwampler/Aquarium/blob/master/aquarium/lib/aquarium.rb
[aquarium/extras.rb]:https://github.com/deanwampler/Aquarium/blob/master/aquarium/lib/aquarium/extras.rb
