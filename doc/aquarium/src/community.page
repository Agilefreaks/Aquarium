## Contributing to Aquarium

There are several ways in which you can contribute to Aquarium. 

## Mailing Lists

One easy way you can contribute is to join and participate in our [mailing lists]:

* *aquarium-users* is for anyone who uses Aquarium. Use this list to discuss any topics related to the use of Aquarium.
* *aquarium-devel* is for those interested in the ongoing development of Aquarium, including those who wish to contribute to the development effort.

## Bugs, Enhancement Requests, etc.

Please use the [RubyForge tracker] to submit bug reports and enhancement requests, rather than using the mailing lists. Discussion of issues on the mailing list is welcome, but the tracker is the best way to capture issues.

It helps greatly if you fork the [Aquarium's GitHub repository] and commit changes (see below).

### Bugs

We want to hear about any bugs that you find, but we can't address them
if we can't reproduce them. If you submit a Bug report, be sure to include:

* The Aquarium version (either a versioned release or [Aquarium's GitHub repository] fork).
* Any other relevant software versions, your OS, <i>etc.</i>
* A failing spec that demonstrates the failure. While code snippets alone are better than nothing, what we really prefer are new specs or modifications to Aquarium's own specs, committed on a [Aquarium's GitHub repository] fork.

This will make us more likely to look at it quickly.

### Feature Requests

Interested in a new feature that you would find useful but don't wish
to develop yourself? Please submit it in a *Feature Request* to [RubyForge tracker].

### Patches

Interested in a new feature that you've already written or want to write?
Please submit a patch, but please follow these guidelines.

* Patch using a fork of [Aquarium's GitHub repository].
* Include updated specs (as appropriate)!
* Include updated docs (as appropriate)!
* Run <code>rake website</code> on your patched source (it runs the specs and generates the docs).
* Create a new ticket in the [RubyForge tracker].
* Mention your GitHub fork.
