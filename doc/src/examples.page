h2. Examples

These examples are all in the "examples" directory that is part of the distribution. Other examples can be found in the 
"README":rdoc/files/README.html, in particular, different ways of expressing the same ideas (for readability...).

h3. Tracing Method Calls

Want to trace invocations of certain methods? This example demonstrates how to do it.

<ruby file="../aquarium/examples/method_tracing_example.rb" /> 

h3. "Enhancing" <code>method_missing</code> Without Overriding

Here is an example of "advising" <code>method_missing</code> to add behavior, rather than overriding it,
which can increase the risk of collisions with overrides from other toolkits:

<ruby file="../aquarium/examples/method_missing_example.rb" /> 

h3. Aspect Design

The AOP community is still discovering good design principles. However, simple extensions of good OOD principles
are an important step. Many of those principles focus on minimal coupling between components and, in particular, coupling
through abstractions, rather than concrete details. 

In this example, we demonstrate how one module defines a pointcut representing an object's state changes. An
"observer" aspect watches for those changes and prints a message when updates occur. Hence, the example demonstrates one
implementation of the Observer Pattern.

Notice how the aspect is independent of the details of the pointcut, so it won't require change as the observed class 
evolves.

<ruby file="../aquarium/examples/aspect_design_example.rb" />

h3. Design by Contract

It is easy to use <span class="keyword">Aquarium</span> to implement a "contract" for a Module, in the sense of Bertrand
Meyer's "Design by Contract". In fact, there is a simple DbC module (not a complete implementation...) in
the "extras":rdoc/files/lib/aquarium/extras_rb.html, which this example uses:

<ruby file="../aquarium/examples/design_by_contract_example.rb" />

Other examples can be found in the "README":rdoc/files/README.html.

h3. Advising Java Classes in JRuby

While you might normally turn to "AspectJ":http://aspectj.org or the "Spring Framework":http://springframework.org/ 
to advise Java classes, if you are using JRuby, you can now use Aquarium! The advantages and disadvantages of Aquarium
compared to AspectJ are listed in the "README":rdoc/files/README.html. Briefly, Aquarium lets you add *and* remove advice
dynamically at runtime, you can advise JDK types easily, and Aquarium lets you advise individual objects. The 
disadvantages of Aquarium are that it will be slower than using AspectJ (although this has not been tested yet), 
Aquarium's pointcut language is not as full-featured as AspectJ's, and there are some bugs and limitations in this initial
support (V0.4.0).

Here is an example of adding tracing calls to a method @doIt@ in all classes that implement the Java interface @com.foo.Work@.

<ruby>
Aspect.new :before, :calls_to => [:doIt, :do_it], :in_types_and_descendents => Java::com.foo.Work do |jp, obj, *args|
  log "Entering: #{jp.target_type.name}##{jp.method_name}: object = #{object}, args = #{args.inspect}" 
end
</ruby>

There are two important points to notice in this example:

# You can choose to refer to the method as @do_it@ (Ruby style) or @doIt@, but these variants are effectively 
treated as *separate* methods; advice on one will not affect invocations of the other. So, if you want to be sure to catch
*all* invocations, use *both* forms. There is a bug (18326) that happens in certain conditions if you use just the Java 
naming convention.
# If the type is an interface, you must use @:types_and_descendents@ (or one of the variants on the word @types@). Since
interfaces don't have method implementations, you will match no join points unless you use the @and_descendents@ clause.
(By default, Aquarium warns you when no join points are matched by an aspect.) However, there is a bug (18325) with this
approach if Java types are subtyped in Ruby.

h4. Limitations and Bugs

(Here's the "fine print"...) In this (V0.4.0) release, there are some important limitations and a few bugs (either in 
Aquarium or JRuby??). 

# Aquarium advice on a method in a Java type will only be invoked when the method is called directly from Ruby.
# To have the advice invoked when the method is called from either Java or Ruby, it is necessary to create a subclass of
the Java type in Ruby and an override of the method, which can just call "super". Note that it will be necessary for 
instances of this Ruby type to be used throughout, not instances of a Java parent type.
# BUG #18325: If you have Ruby subclasses of Java types *and* you advise a Java method in the hierarchy using 
@:types_and_descendents => MyJavaBaseClassOrInterface@ *and* you call unadvise on the aspect, the advice "infrastructure" is
not correctly removed from the Ruby types. Workaround: Only advise methods in Ruby subclasses of Java types where the 
method is explicitly overridden in the Ruby class. (The spec and the "Rubyforge bug report":http://rubyforge.org/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=18325&group_id=4281&atid=16494 provide examples.)
# BUG #18326: Normally, you can use either Java- or Ruby-style method names (e.g., "doSomething" vs. "do_something"),
for Java types. However, if you write an aspect using the Java-style for a method name and a Ruby subclass of the Java
type where the method is actually defined (i.e., the Ruby class doesn't override the method), it appears that the 
JoinPoint was advised, but the advice is never called. Workaround: Use the Ruby-style name in this scenario.

For more details, see the RSpec examples in the @jruby/spec@ directory.

h3. Testing Uses of Aspects

Aspects are sometimes used for "fault injection", to enable easier testing of error handling logic, and for stubbing
expensive methods, using around advice. The latter technique complements mocking frameworks. You can see an example
of stubbing the expensive <code>TypeUtils#descendents</code> in <code>Aquarium::TypeUtilsStub</code> (in 
<code>spec_example_types.rb</code>) and the use of it in <code>spec/aquarium/aspects/pointcut_spec.rb</code>.
