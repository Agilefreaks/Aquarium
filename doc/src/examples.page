h2. Examples

These examples are all in the "examples" directory that is part of the distribution. Other examples can be found in the 
"README":rdoc/files/README.html, in particular, different ways of expressing the same ideas (for readability...).

h3. Tracing Method Calls

Want to trace invocations of certain methods? This example demonstrates how to do it.

<ruby file="../aquarium/examples/method_tracing_example.rb" /> 

h3. "Enhancing" <code>method_missing</code> Without Overriding

Here is an example of "advising" <code>method_missing</code> to add behavior, rather than overriding it,
which can increase the risk of collisions with overrides from other toolkits:

<ruby file="../aquarium/examples/method_missing_example.rb" /> 

h3. "Wrapping" an Exception: Rescuing one type and raising another

While it's tempting to try this with :after_raising advice, this won't work, because you can't change the control flow
with any form of advice, except for :around advice. (See, however, feature request #19119.) Here is the idiom to use.

<ruby file="../aquarium/examples/exception_wrapping_example.rb" /> 

h3. "Hack" to Create a Reusable Aspect that Is Defined When a Module is Included in Another

It's actually harder than it should be to define a reusable aspect, because the aspect is evaluated when it's defined,
which means the pointcut needs to be known at that time. Feature request #19122 will address this issue. For now, 
here's a hack that works around the limitation. Make sure you heed the warning!

<ruby file="../aquarium/examples/reusable_aspect_hack_example.rb" /> 

h3. Aspect Design

The AOP community is still discovering good design principles. However, simple extensions of good OOD principles
are an important step. Many of those principles focus on minimal coupling between components and, in particular, coupling
through abstractions, rather than concrete details. 

In this example, we demonstrate how one module defines a pointcut representing an object's state changes. An
"observer" aspect watches for those changes and prints a message when updates occur. Hence, the example demonstrates one
implementation of the Observer Pattern.

Notice how the aspect is independent of the details of the pointcut, so it won't require change as the observed class 
evolves.

<ruby file="../aquarium/examples/aspect_design_example.rb" />

h3. Design by Contract

It is easy to use <span class="keyword">Aquarium</span> to implement a "contract" for a Module, in the sense of Bertrand
Meyer's "Design by Contract". In fact, there is a simple DbC module (not a complete implementation...) in
the "extras":rdoc/files/lib/aquarium/extras_rb.html, which this example uses:

<ruby file="../aquarium/examples/design_by_contract_example.rb" />

Other examples can be found in the "README":rdoc/files/README.html.

h3. Testing Uses of Aspects

Aspects are sometimes used for "fault injection", to enable easier testing of error handling logic, and for stubbing
expensive methods, using around advice. The latter technique complements mocking frameworks. You can see an example
of stubbing the expensive <code>TypeUtils#descendents</code> in <code>Aquarium::TypeUtilsStub</code> (in 
<code>spec_example_types.rb</code>) and the use of it in <code>spec/aquarium/aspects/pointcut_spec.rb</code>.
