h2. Contribute to Aquarium

There are several ways in which you can contribute to Aquarium. 

h2. Mailing Lists

One easy way you can contribute is to join and participate in our mailing lists:

"http://rubyforge.org/mail/?group_id=4281":http://rubyforge.org/mail/?group_id=4281

* aquarium-users is for anyone who uses Aquarium. Use this list to discuss any topics related to
the use of Aquarium.
* aquarium-devel is for those interested in the ongoing development of Aquarium,
including those who wish to contribute to the development effort.

Since there will (hopefully!) be a reasonable amount of traffic on these lists, 
please mark off-topic posts with an "[OT]" prefix in the subject line.

h2. Requests For Enhancement (RFEs)

Please use the "RubyForge tracker":http://rubyforge.org/tracker/?group_id=4281 to submit Requests For 
Enhancement, rather than using the mailing lists. Discussion of issues on the mailing list is welcome,
but the tracker is the best way to capture issues.

So, for Feature Requests, Patches and Bugs, please be sure to select the appropriate
category.

"RubyForge tracker":http://rubyforge.org/tracker/?group_id=4281

Wherever feasible, <b><i>please</i></b> submit a complete RSpec specification that we can run, such as
the following example:

<ruby>
describe "My Problem" do
  it "can be reproduced as follows" do
    # Why doesn't this work?
    # (This is just a silly example)
    true.should be_true
  end
end
</ruby>

This will make us more likely to look at it quickly.

h3. Feature Requests

Interested in a new feature that you would find useful but don't wish
to develop yourself? Please submit it in a Feature Request.

h3. Patches

Interested in a new feature that you've already written or want to write?
Please submit a patch, but please follow these guidelines.

* patch against svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/aquarium/trunk (do not patch against a released gem)
* include specs!
* include docs!
* run "rake website" on your patched source (it runs the specs and generates the docs).
* create a patch with "svn diff > description_of_patch.diff"
* create a new ticket in the "RubyForge tracker":http://rubyforge.org/tracker/?group_id=4281
* attach the diff file to the ticket. <b><i>Don't forget to tick the checkbox or your patch will get lost!</i></b>

h3. Bugs

We want to hear about any bugs that you find, but we can't address them
if we can't reproduce them. If you submit a Bug report, be sure to include:

* The Aquarium version (either a versioned release or svn revision number).
* Any other relevant software versions, OSes, <i>etc.</i>
* A failing spec <b>and</b> code that demonstrate the failure. While code snippets alone are better than nothing, what we really prefer are modifications to Aquarium's own specs, as a unified diff file.

h3. Thank You!

Thanks for your interest in Aquarium!
