# Example demonstrating "around" advice for method_missing. This is a technique for
# avoiding collisions when different toolkits want to override method_missing in the
# same classes, e.g., Object. Using around advice as shown allows a toolkit to add 
# custom behavior while invoking the "native" method_missing to handle unrecognized
# method calls.
# Note that it is essential to use around advice, not before or after advice, because
# neither can prevent the call to the "wrapped" method_missing, which is presumably
# not what you want.
# In this (contrived) example, an Echo class uses method_missing to simply echo
# the method name and arguments. An aspect is used to intercept any calls to a 
# fictitious "log" method and handle those in a different way.
