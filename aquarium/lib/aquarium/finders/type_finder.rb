      # You can also append the suffix "_of" on any of the "*_descendents", "*_ancestors",
      # and "*_types" keys.
      #
      # ==== Namespaces (Modules) and Regular Expressions
      # Because of the special sigificance of the module ("namespace") separator "::", 
      # special rules for the regular expressions apply. Normally, you can just use the
      # "*_and_nested_types" or "*_and_nested" to match enclosed types, but if you want to
      # be selective, note the following. First, assume that "subexp" is a "sub regular 
      # expression" that results if you split on the separator "::".
      #
      # A full regexp with no "::"::
      #   Allow partial matches, <i>i.e.</i>, as if you wrote <tt>/^.*#{regexp}.*$/.</tt>
      # 
      # A subexp before the first "::"::
      #   It behaves as <tt>/^.*#{subexp}::.../</tt>, meaning that the end of "subexp" 
      #   must be followed by "::".
      #
      # A subexp after the last "::"::
      #   It behaves as <tt>/...::#{subexp}$/</tt>, meaning that the beginning of "subexp"
      #   must immediately follow a "::".
      #
      # For a subexp between two "::"::
      #   It behaves as <tt>/...::#{subexp}::.../</tt>, meaning that the subexp must match 
      #   the whole name between the "::" exactly.
      #
      # Note: a common idiom in aspects is to include descendents of a type, but not the type
      # itself. You can do as in the following example:
      #   <tt>... :type_and_descendents => "Foo", :exclude_type => "Foo"
