== Release Plan

=== Versions 0.1.X

Mostly bug fixes and enhancements. Only "minor" breakages of backwards compatibility.

=== Versions 0.2.0

Change the argument list for advice to |join_point, object, *args| from |join_point, *args|, 
where "*args" are the arguments passed to the invoked join point (method). Since nontrivial 
advice usually needs the object being advised, it became clear that having to call 
"join_point.context.advised_object" is too tedious. 

This change will obvious break existing aspects.

=== Versions 0.3+.0

More refinements to the API and functionality. The main thrust will be expanding the pointcut 
language to include conditionals and stack context constructs, as well as more intuitive ways
of expressing sets of types, such as types nested arbitrarily deep in module "namespaces",
etc.

=== Version 1.0.0

Reasonable stable and full-featured API and DSL.
