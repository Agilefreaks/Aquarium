== Version 0.4.0

V0.4.0 adds specs to characterize and test advising Java classes when running on JRuby and adds several 
API enhancements.

Bug fixes:
17844	JRuby - Advising types, Aquarium thinks the type is a string
17883	Workaround for JRUBY-2089
18090	JoinPoint#invoke_original_join_point only works with :around advice

Enhancements:
17834	Allow :class and :module (and variants) wherever :type is allowed
17881	Add specs that exercise advising Java types and objects using JRuby

#17844 occurred because of the way JRuby encodes Java packages into modules. Aquarium now properly handles 
JRuby types.

#17883 reflected a JRuby bug, so a workaround was required.
 
#17834 allows the user to substitute the words "class", "classes", "module" or "modules" anywhere the words
"type" and "types" are used in the API, since some users might naturally want to write aspects like this:

 	around :calls_to => :my_method, :in_class => MyClass do ...; end

However, there is no enforcement to ensure that "class" is only used for classes and "module" is only used
for modules, etc. Note: it's possible we'll enforce this in some future release, as a way of saying things
like "only advise classes that match ...", etc. Caveat Emptor!

For #18090, a bug prevented JoinPoint#invoke_original_join_point (which allows you to bypass all advices at
the join point) from working except for :around advice (and yes, the specs didn't cover this adequately -
gasp!). Now fixed.

For #17881, I created a separate set of specs for JRuby, so it's easier to run the "regular" Aquarium
specs using MRI and the JRuby-specific specs separately with JRuby. The new "jruby" directory contains a 
Rakefile, another set of specs, and Java example code for the specs to use. The default Rakefile task 
re-runs the main Aquarium spec suite using JRuby, to confirm that the suite passes successfully, then it
runs a set of different specs that load sample Java interfaces and classes into JRuby and then advises
them with Aquarium.

I found a few JRuby bugs and other behavior differences between MRI during this release. I was able to handle
them with modifications to the Aquarium code. If you "grep" the Aquarium "lib" and "spec" directories for the
word "jruby" (ignoring case), you'll find notes about these issues and the workarounds I implemented.

The separate JRuby spec suite shows what you can and cannot do with Java types. As a side benefit, it also
demonstrates how Java types, objects, and methods are mapped to Ruby. There are some important limitations,
however. See the "JRuby.html":jruby.html page or the README for more details. 

Note: JRuby 1.1RC2 was used.

 
== Version 0.3.1

V0.3.1 adds numerous performance improvements, especially in the RSpec suite, and some minor API additions.

Bug fixes:
N.A.

Enhancements:
14447	Unify internal handling of reporting errors to the user
17514	Provide an Aquarium library-wide logger with configuration parameters and instance overrides
17515	Add an optional warning if an aspect doesn't match any join points
17516	Remove unnecessary examples that use :types_and_descendents to shorten time to run the RSpec suite
17565	JoinPoint.new should convert a type name, symbol, or regex to the type and only allow one type

These first two enhancements are related. There is a now an Aquarium::Utils::DefaultLogger
module with static accessors for getting and setting the "system-wide" logger. 

When instance-level overrides are necessary, the Aquarium::Utils::OptionsUtils provides 
"universal" options (but currently used only by Aspect and Pointcut) for specifying a logger 
(with the new :logger parameter), or alternatively, specifying just the output stream 
(:logger_stream) and/or the severity (:severity, one of the standard library's 
Logger::Severity-defined constants). If either of the latter two options is specified, a 
separate logger instance is created, rather than changing parameters for the global logger.

OptionsUtils also supports a :noop parameter, which classes interpret to mean do none (or
perhaps only some) of the processing. Useful for debugging.

#17515 adds a helpful warning to the system (or aspect-instance's) logger if an aspect 
matches no join points. This warning will be suppressed if (i) the severity level for the 
logger is above WARN or (ii) the aspect was created with the option 
	:ignore_no_matching_join_points => true.

#17516 fixes halved the long execution times for the whole RSpec suite by refactoring some examples
that used type finders with the :types_and_descendents option unnecessarily. It is a very intensive
computation! Note that I stubbed out these calls using an aspect with around advise, a useful
"development-time" aspect. See Aquarium::TypeUtilsStub (in spec_example_types.rb) and how it's used
in pointcut_spec.rb. Using this technique and other optimizations, the time to run the suite was 
reduced from ~5 minutes to about 1 minute.
 
#17565 fixes a "hole" in JoinPoint, where it doesn't confirm that a specified type string, symbol
or regex matches a class that exists and only one class. Now it does and it stores the type, rather
than the original "specification" for it.

== Version 0.3.0

V0.3.0 adds numerous improvements to the DSL, making aspect specification more intuitive and 
English-like. For example, where you previously wrote, e.g.,

	around :methods => :all, :types => [Foo, Bar], :advice => advice_proc
	after  :attribute => name, :attribute_options => [:readers], :objects => [foo, bar] ...
	
Now you can write the same aspects as follows:

	around :calls_to => :all_methods, :within_types => [Foo, Bar], :use_advice => advice_proc
	after  :reading => name, :on_objects => [foo, bar] ...

Other improvements include performance and robustness enhancements and miscellaneous internal 
refactoring and DRY improvements.

Bug fixes:
16267	gem not updating

Enhancements:
17154	More intuitive synonyms for specifying types, methods and attributes

For #17154, the following changes were made:
Added :all_methods as a synonym for the :all special value.
Added :reading as a synonym for :attributes => ..., :attribute_options => [:readers]
Added :writing and :changing as synonyms for :attributes => ..., :attribute_options => [:writers]
Added :accessing as a synonym for :attributes => ...
Added :calls_to, :calling, :invoking, :sending_message_to  as synonyms for :methods.
Added :on_types, :in_types, :within_types and :for_types as synonyms for :types. The same
set of prefixes is supported for :type, :objects, :object, and the various :exclude_*, 
:*_and_ancestors, and :*_and_descendents.

The full list of possible synonyms are shown in the spec examples. In particular, see "pointcut_spec.rb".


== Version 0.2.0

V0.2.0 changes the parameter list used for advice blocks and adds numerous enhancements, robustness
improvements and more complete "spec'ing".

Bug fixes:
none

Enhancements:
13402	Support a subclass syntax like AspectJ's "Type+"
13984	More flexible argument list to the advise block
14053	Remove JoinPoint#type, JoinPoint#type=, JoinPoint#object, and JoinPoint#object=
14061	Add a control flow mechanism to skipping (sic) intermediate advice
15164	Deprecate ObjectFinder
15413	Remove ObjectFinder
15710	Eliminate redundant public methods in various "finders"

#13402 adds new invocation options to specify types and their descendents (subclasses or modules
that include the specified module(s)) and ancestors. The latter should be used cautiously as it
will include things like Kernel, Object, and Class!  I used new command options rather than the
AspectJ "+" suffix (and the proposed, but never implemented "-" suffix for ancestors), because
the "+" would be confusing with regular expressions and not in the spirit of trying to make
the pointcut language "easy to read". So, the following are now available:
  :type_and_ancestors
  :types_and_ancestors
  :type_and_descendents
  :types_and_descendents
And the corresponding:
  :exclude_type_and_ancestors
  :exclude_types_and_ancestors
  :exclude_type_and_descendents
  :exclude_types_and_descendents
If you want both the ancestors and descendents, just use both options with the same value.

#13984 adds the object as the second argument to the advice block parameter list. This change
reflects the fact that the object is often needed, but calling jp.context.advised_object is a
bit tedious. THIS CHANGE BREAKS BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY!! An exception is raised if advice has
the signature |jp, *args|.

#14061 adds a new method, JoinPoint#invoke_original_join_point, which will invoke the original
method without intermediate advice. If called within around advice, you can write advice that 
vetoes all subsequent advice, yet invokes the original method. Use this technique cautiously, 
however, since you may not always know what other advices are involved and what side effects 
this control-flow change might cause.

#15164 and 15413 remove ObjectFinder because it is not used and it requires ObjectSpace, which 
has high overhead and won't be enabled, by default, in JRuby (it will be optional).

#15710 removes redundant methods that were becoming a maintenance issue, in particular, 
MethodFinder#find_all_by and TypeFinder#find_by_name. This is a non-backwards-compatible API
change. 

Finally, note that I have not yet been able to resolve bug #15202, "Intermittent confusion
between classes and objects when invoking advice." I believe this is a very rare occurrence
and only likely to ever happen during the "torture-test" of running the RSpec suite. Please post
a comment to Tracker if you encounter it!

== Version 0.1.8

V0.1.7 did not successfully "register" at rubyforge. This releases fixes that problem and also
adds several feature enhancements and refactorings. There are no known upgrade issues.

Bug fixes:
none

Enhancements:
13399	Add :exclusion options for methods and types.
14707	:exclude_ancestor_methods as synonym for :suppress_ancestor_methods

13399 adds new :exclude_(pointcuts|join_points|types|objects|methods|attributes) options for
Aspect.new, and Pointcut.new that make it easier to specify a list or regular expression for 
various "items" and then to exclude particular items, e.g.,
	Aspect.new :around, :types => /nterestingType/, :exclude_types => UninterestingType ...

The :exclude_ancestor_methods option is now preferred over :suppress_ancestor_methods,
since the former is more consistent with the new :exclude_* options.

== Version 0.1.7

Bug fixes:
14946	Advice fails when instrumenting methods containing special characters
15038	Spec for pointcut example variation #1
15039	Spec for pointcut example variation #2
15085	Specifying just :attributes for aspects also matches all methods, as if :methods =&gt; :all specified

Enhancements:
13396	Unify internal handling of types vs. objects

15038 and 15039 were bugs in one of the examples (actually in the comments). However, 
experimenting with them also revealed the nasty 15085 bug!

I previously handled some special characters in method names, but not all the possible
ones, hence 14946. Aquarium should now properly handle any valid Ruby method name.


== Version 0.1.6

Bug fixes:
14353	Advising subclass method that calls super raises exception when method executed
14356	Regexps for types must cover the whole name, which is inconsistent with method/attribute regexps
14384	Design by Contract "extra" does not return correct value "invar" handling
13410	Fix funky navigation bar on website

14353 was kind of bad, but it's actually a Ruby bug with a good workaround. If you 
advised a method that called "super", Ruby would use the wrong method name to lookup the
class in the parent. See the bug description for the details.

For 14356, type regular expressions now match on parts of names; they don't have to match
the whole name. The exception is regular expressions with module separators "::". In this
case, it seems to make more sense for the regular expression to be interpreted as follows:
If the expression is /A::B::C::D/, then for the the outermost types, the expression behaves
as /^.*A/, for the types between two "::", the expressions behave as /^B$/ and /^C$/, and
the trailing expression behaves as /D.*$/.

14384 was an easy mistake to make with "around" advice; you have to remember to return the 
result of the "join_point.proceed" call, unless you specifically want to change the returned
value! Here are two ways to do it:

	do_something_before(...)
	result = join_point.proceed
	do_something_after(...)
	return result

or
	
	begin
		do_something_before(...)
		join_point.proceed
	ensure
		do_something_after(...)
	end

The latter approach looks "asymmetrical" and it will behave differently if "proceed" raises!
However, it eliminates the temporary, if you find that desirable.
 
Enhancements:
13407	Pick a better method name for JoinPoint#type, which hides the Module#type
14385	Pointcut.new should accept a :join_point => jp argument
14386	Aspect.new ..., :pointcut => should accept a join point object
14440	Add good warning message when "proceed" used for non-around advice

For 13407, new attribute methods have been added
* JoinPoint#target_type 	return the type that the join_point matches.
* JoinPoint#target_type=	set the type that the join_point matches.
* JoinPoint#target_object 	return the object that the join_point matches.
* JoinPoint#target_object=	set the object that the join_point matches.

The following, older methods are now deprecated and will be removed in the 0.2.0 release (#14053):
* JoinPoint#type
* JoinPoint#type=
* JoinPoint#object
* JoinPoint#object=

JoinPoint#type method is deprecated because it hides Module#type, which returns the type of 
the corresponding object. For "symmetry", the other three methods are also now deprecated and 
they will be removed in a future release. Until then, all will print a warning message to 
STDOUT. (If you really want the type of what could be a JoinPoint object, you should use #class
anyway, as Module#type is also deprecated!)

== Version 0.1.5

Bug fixes:
13514	Protected and private methods are made public when advised and left that way when unadvised
13650	Loading Aquarium interferes with Rails filters
13864	Bug with negative object_id

Enhancements:
13392	Convert examples to specs.
13463	Support running in JRuby

Fixing 13650 required an API change, which is why I've tagged this release "0.1.5" instead of
something like "0.1.1" (and the changes don't seem big enough to warrant "0.2.0"...).

Previously, requiring "aquarium.rb" in the top-level "lib" directory would implicitly require 
lib/aquarium/aspects/dsl/aspect_dsl.rb, which
has Object include the AspectDSL module. This module adds methods like :before and :after to Object. 
Unfortunately, those methods collide with methods of the same name that Rails adds to Object. It was 
also a bit presumptuous of me to assume that everyone wanted those methods on Object ;)

In this release, aspect_dsl.rb is still implicitly included and it still defines the AspectDSL 
module. Now, however, it does not include the AspectDSL module in Object. Instead, if you want this 
behavior for all types, you must require the new lib/aquarium/aspects/dsl/object_dsl.rb explicitly. 

As an alternative, if you just want the AspectDSL module included selectively in certain types, 
then do the following:

	class MyClass   # reopen "MyClass"
		# Add the methods as _class_ methods
		include Aquarium::Aspects::DSL::AspectDSL
	end

or, use (class|module)_eval:

	require 'aquarium/aspects/dsl/aspect_dsl'

	MyClass.class_eval do
		# Add the methods as _class_ methods
		include Aquarium::Aspects::DSL::AspectDSL
	end

To add the methods as _instance_ methods on individual objects:

	object = MyClass.new
	object.extend(Aquarium::Aspects::DSL::AspectDSL)


Note: as discussed at http://practicalruby.blogspot.com/2007/02/reopen-with-moduleeval.html, 
using "class_eval" or "module_eval" is safer that just reopening a class if 
you're not sure that "MyClass" has actually been defined yet. However, in our particular case, it 
probably doesn't matter, as AspectDSL doesn't change anything about the type, like aliasing existing 
methods. Still, we can't guarantee that this won't change in the future.

== Version 0.1.0

This is the initial version.
